# PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS<a name="CHAP_PostgreSQL"></a>

Amazon RDS supports DB instances running several versions of PostgreSQL\. You can create DB instances and DB snapshots, point\-in\-time restores and backups\. DB instances running PostgreSQL support Multi\-AZ deployments, Read Replicas \(version 9\.3\.5 and later\), Provisioned IOPS, and can be created inside a VPC\. You can also use Secure Socket Layer \(SSL\) to connect to a DB instance running PostgreSQL\.

Before creating a DB instance, you should complete the steps in the [Setting Up for Amazon RDS](CHAP_SettingUp.md) section of this guide\. 

You can use any standard SQL client application to run commands for the instance from your client computer\. Such applications include *pgAdmin*, a popular Open Source administration and development tool for PostgreSQL, or *psql*, a command line utility that is part of a PostgreSQL installation\. In order to deliver a managed service experience, Amazon RDS does not provide host access to DB instances, and it restricts access to certain system procedures and tables that require advanced privileges\. Amazon RDS supports access to databases on a DB instance using any standard SQL client application\. Amazon RDS does not allow direct host access to a DB instance via Telnet or Secure Shell \(SSH\)\. 

Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL is compliant with many industry standards\. For example, you can use Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL databases to build HIPAA\-compliant applications and to store healthcare\-related information, including protected health information \(PHI\) under an executed Business Associate Agreement \(BAA\) with AWS\. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL also meets Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program \(FedRAMP\) security requirements\. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL has received a FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board \(JAB\) Provisional Authority to Operate \(P\-ATO\) at the FedRAMP HIGH Baseline within the AWS GovCloud \(US\) Region\. For more information on supported compliance standards, see [AWS Cloud Compliance](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/)\.

To import PostgreSQL data into a DB instance, follow the information in the [Importing Data into PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS](PostgreSQL.Procedural.Importing.md) section\.

## Common Management Tasks for PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS<a name="CHAP_PostgreSQL.CommonTasks"></a>

The following are the common management tasks you perform with an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL DB instance, with links to relevant documentation for each task\. 


| Task Area | Relevant Documentation | 
| --- | --- | 
|  **Setting up Amazon RDS for first\-time use** There are prerequisites you must complete before you create your DB instance\. For example, DB instances are created by default with a firewall that prevents access to it\. You therefore must create a security group with the correct IP addresses and network configuration to access the DB instance\.   |  [Setting Up for Amazon RDS](CHAP_SettingUp.md)  | 
|  **Understanding Amazon RDS DB instances** If you are creating a DB instance for production purposes, you should understand how instance classes, storage types, and Provisioned IOPS work in Amazon RDS\.   |  [DB Instance Class](Concepts.DBInstanceClass.md) [Amazon RDS Storage Types](CHAP_Storage.md#Concepts.Storage) [Provisioned IOPS Storage](CHAP_Storage.md#USER_PIOPS)  | 
|  **Finding supported PostgreSQL versions** Amazon RDS supports several versions of PostgreSQL\.   |  [Supported PostgreSQL Database Versions](PostgreSQL.Concepts.md#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.DBVersions)  | 
|  **Setting up high availability and failover support** A production DB instance should use Multi\-AZ deployments\. Multi\-AZ deployments provide increased availability, data durability, and fault tolerance for DB instances\.   |  [High Availability \(Multi\-AZ\)](Concepts.MultiAZ.md)  | 
|  **Understanding the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\) network** If your AWS account has a default VPC, then your DB instance is automatically created inside the default VPC\. If your account does not have a default VPC, and you want the DB instance in a VPC, you must create the VPC and subnet groups before you create the DB instance\.   |  [Determining Whether You Are Using the EC2\-VPC or EC2\-Classic Platform](USER_VPC.FindDefaultVPC.md) [Working with an Amazon RDS DB Instance in a VPC](USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.md)  | 
|  **Importing data into Amazon RDS PostgreSQL** You can use several different tools to import data into your PostgreSQL DB instance on Amazon RDS\.   |  [Importing Data into PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS](PostgreSQL.Procedural.Importing.md)  | 
|  **Setting up read only Read Replicas \(master/standby\)** PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS supports Read Replicas in both the same AWS Region and in a different AWS Region from the master instance\.  |  [Working with Read Replicas of MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL DB Instances](USER_ReadRepl.md) [PostgreSQL Read Replicas \(Version 9\.3\.5 and Later\)PostgreSQL Read Replicas](USER_ReadRepl.md#USER_ReadRepl.PostgreSQL) [Creating a Read Replica in a Different AWS Region](USER_ReadRepl.md#USER_ReadRepl.XRgn)  | 
|  **Understanding security groups** By default, DB instances are created with a firewall that prevents access to them\. You therefore must create a security group with the correct IP addresses and network configuration to access the DB instance\.  In general, if your DB instance is on the *EC2\-Classic* platform, you need to create a DB security group\. If your DB instance is on the *EC2\-VPC* platform, you need to create a VPC security group\.   |  [Determining Whether You Are Using the EC2\-VPC or EC2\-Classic Platform](USER_VPC.FindDefaultVPC.md) [Amazon RDS Security Groups](Overview.RDSSecurityGroups.md)  | 
|  **Setting up parameter groups and features** If your DB instance is going to require specific database parameters, you should create a parameter group before you create the DB instance\.   |  [Working with DB Parameter Groups](USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.md)  | 
|  **Performing common DBA tasks for PostgreSQL** Some of the more common tasks for PostgreSQL DBAs include:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_PostgreSQL.html)  |  [Common DBA Tasks for PostgreSQL](Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.md)  | 
|  **Connecting to your PostgreSQL DB instance** After creating a security group and associating it to a DB instance, you can connect to the DB instance using any standard SQL client application such as pgadmin III\.   |  [Connecting to a DB Instance Running the PostgreSQL Database Engine](USER_ConnectToPostgreSQLInstance.md) [Using SSL with a PostgreSQL DB Instance](PostgreSQL.Concepts.md#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.SSL)  | 
|  **Backing up and restoring your DB instance** You can configure your DB instance to take automated backups, or take manual snapshots, and then restore instances from the backups or snapshots\.   |  [Backing Up and Restoring Amazon RDS DB Instances](CHAP_CommonTasks.BackupRestore.md)  | 
|  **Monitoring the activity and performance of your DB instance** You can monitor a PostgreSQL DB instance by using CloudWatch Amazon RDS metrics, events, and enhanced monitoring\.   |  [Viewing DB Instance Metrics](CHAP_Monitoring.md#USER_Monitoring) [Viewing Amazon RDS Events](USER_ListEvents.md)  | 
|  **Upgrading the PostgreSQL database version** You can do both major and minor version upgrades for your PostgreSQL DB instance\.   |  [Upgrading a PostgreSQL DB Instance](PostgreSQL.Concepts.md#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.Patching) [Major Version Upgrades](USER_UpgradeDBInstance.PostgreSQL.md#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.PostgreSQL.MajorVersion)  | 
|  **Working with log files** You can access the log files for your PostgreSQL DB instance\.   |  [PostgreSQL Database Log Files](USER_LogAccess.Concepts.PostgreSQL.md)  | 
|  **Understanding the best practices for PostgreSQL DB instances** Find some of the best practices for working with PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS\.   |  [Best Practices for Working with PostgreSQL](CHAP_BestPractices.md#CHAP_BestPractices.PostgreSQL)  |
