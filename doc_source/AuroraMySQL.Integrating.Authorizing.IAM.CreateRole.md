After creating an IAM policy to allow Aurora to access AWS resources, you must create an IAM role and attach the IAM policy to the new IAM role\.

To create an IAM role to permit your Amazon RDS cluster to communicate with other AWS services on your behalf, take the following steps\.

**To create an IAM role to allow Amazon RDS to access AWS services**

1. Open the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#home)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**\.

1. Choose **Create role**\.

1. Under **AWS service**, choose **RDS**\.

1. Under **Select your use case**, choose **RDS â€“ CloudHSM and Directory Service**\.

1. Choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. Choose **Next: Review**\.

1. Set **Role Name** to a name for your IAM role, for example `RDSLoadFromS3`\. You can also add an optional **Role Description** value\.

1. Choose **Create Role**\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**\.

1. In the **Search** field, enter the name of the role you created, and click the role when it appears in the list\.

1. On the **Permissions** tab, detach the following default roles from the policy:

   + `AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess`

   + `RDSCloudHsmAuthorizationRole`

   To detach a role, click the **X** associated with the role on the right, and then click **Detach**\.

1. On the **Permissions** tab, choose **Attach policy**\.

1. On the **Attach policy** page, enter the name of your policy in the **Search** field\.

1. When it appears in the list, select the policy that you defined earlier in either [Creating an IAM Policy to Access Amazon S3 Resources](AuroraMySQL.Integrating.Authorizing.IAM.S3CreatePolicy.md), [Creating an IAM Policy to Access AWS Lambda Resources](AuroraMySQL.Integrating.Authorizing.IAM.LambdaCreatePolicy.md), or [Allowing Amazon Aurora to Access Amazon CloudWatch Logs Resources](AuroraMySQL.Integrating.Authorizing.IAM.CWCreatePolicy.md)\.
